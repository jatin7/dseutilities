## Description

This repository contains a list of Misc. utilities, sample codes, and blog posts that I wrote in order to ease the learning and working with DataStax Enterprise (DSE). 

**Disclaimer**: Most, if not all, of the utilities/sample codes/blog posts are based on DSE 5.1.x version (the latest major DSE release as of writing). For older DSE versions such as 5.0.x or 4.8.x, please use at your own discretion and feel free to test out by yourself.
